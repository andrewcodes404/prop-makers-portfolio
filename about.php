       <p>My most recent job was working for Harvey Nichols Workshop making and installing props for their Window Displays. We were involved from the development of the project and could be very creative with the props through to installation. Preceding that I worked on Tim Burtonâ€™s Dark Shadows and James Bond Skyfall as a textile breakdown artist.</p>
       <br>

      <p>I have worked as a Scenic Painter and Prop-maker on many West End Theatre shows and Opera productions including Holland Park Opera, The ENO, The Old Vic, Savoy theatre, working for scenery companies around London and regionally including Capital Scenery and Souvenir Scenic.</p>

    <br>

    <p>I experienced a year working at a repertory theatre in Essex as a scenic painter working on many in house productions. I am used to working to tight deadlines and budgets, ordering materials and interpreting designs, I am very organised with a great attention to detail. With my background in Fine Art I believe I work with creativity and ingenuity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoy any chance I get to sculpt, paint and create and love learning about different materials and techniques. In my spare time I enjoy drawing and doing my artwork.</p>
